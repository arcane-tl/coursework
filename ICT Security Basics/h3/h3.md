## Examples of Public Key Cryptography (h3-b)

### HTTPS
This is propably the most common use case for public key cryptography. We use this multiple times a day when browsing the internet, paying our bills, etc. To keep our internet activities safe websites rely on HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between the server and the client. This encryption is done using certificates which relies on public key cryptography.

Here the webserver has been issued a certificate by a CA (certificate authority) and they're using that certificate to distribute their public key. Now when you browse to a HTTPS-site the first thing will be that the server sends your client the certificate and should it be a trusted certificate your browser will automatically start using the public key there to encrypt the traffic to that webserver. The first thing happening here will be a key exchange after which all the communication will be then encrypted between the client and the server.

### Digital Signatures
Often times when doing business over the internet it is needed to verify that the entity you're dealing with is actually who they say they are and that the data sent to you is actually coming from that particular entity. Here is where digital signatures come into play. Let's say I would like to sign a legally valid contract with a company online. They would need to verify that it's indeed me who is signing the contract.

Digital signatures work with public key cryptography so that upon signing the contract the signee will actually create a digital signature using their private key. Here is a good illustration from DocuSign (https://www.docusign.com/how-it-works/electronic-signature/digital-signature/digital-signature-faq):
