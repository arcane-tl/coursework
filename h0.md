# Capturing network traffic
## Installing Kali-linux
At the beginning of this course I installed Kali-linux on VirtualBox by Oracle to do the tasks needed for the course work. Installation was simple using the documentation from [kali.org](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/).

First step was to download the VirtualBox image which was readily available from the [kali.org virtual machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) section.

After downloading it's useful to check that the SHA256 checksum from kali.org matches with the downloaded files checksum to make sure the file has not been tampered with during transit.

Checksum from kali.org for the file:

Checksum calculated using Microsoft Powershell Get-FileHash:

I already had Oracle VirtualBox installed on my Windows 10 desktop so adding the Kali-linux was simple. I did tweak a bit of the virtual machine properties and allocated a bit more memory and CPU for the VM.

## Testing the VM with network packet sniffing
When the Kali-linux was set up I thought about changing the default usernames and passwords of the virtual machine but decided that it's not worth the effort for these exercises at this point. I might change my mind later. Next I wanted to test that the setup works correctly so it was time to fire up Wireshark and capture some packets.

So the plan here is to:
1. Open Wireshark and CLI in Kali Linux
2. Start Wireshark capture on the network interface & create some network traffic with ping
3. Export the captured packets to a file
4. Analyze what happened

### 1. Open Wireshark and CLI in Kali Linux

### 2. Start Wireshark capture on the network interface & create some network traffic with ping

First we need to choose the network interface from Wireshark from which we want to capture the packets. In my case it will be the default network interface eth0. After this selection the capture will be live. On idle there should be little or no network traffic to or from Kali Linux so next we need to run a ping command on the *[CLI]: Command-line interface:

```
ping www.google.com -c 3
```
