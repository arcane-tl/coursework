# SELECT pwned

## OWASP 10 (h3-x)

### A1 Injection
+ Common injection types are SQL, OS command, and LDAP.
+ Applications are vulnerable when user-supplied data is not validated, filtered or sanitized by the application
+ Impact of the injection can be severe and result to a complete host takeover
+ Injections are done by inserting hostile code into SQL calls and other queries

### A2 Broken Authentication
+ There are many ways authentication can be broken: weak hash or plain text passwords in the system, no preventive measures for brute force attacks or automated attacks, failure to handle sessions in a secure way, etc
+ Users can prevent falling victim by using different strong password in all systems and activating MFA (multi-factor authentication) when possible
+ Most common attack type is credential stuffing where the attacker uses a list of known passwords to gain access to the system

### A3 Sensitive Data Exposure
+ Common attack types are man-in-the-middle attack or stealing clear text data/secrets off the server or from the user while the data is in transit from the client
+ Can be prevented by encrypting data in transit and at rest and making sure no unnecessary data is stored

### A7 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
+ There are three types of XSS attacks: Reflected, Stored and DOM
+ Typical XSS attacks include session stealing, account takeover, MFA bypass, keylogging, malicious downloads, and DOM node replacement or defacement

## The Complete Ethical Hacking Course (video): Chapter 21: Cross Site Scripting
+ Here the lecturer introduced two-types of XSS attacks (reflected and stored) and demonstrates how they can be exploited
+ BeEF is a tool that can be utilized with stored XSS attack to run malicious code on the client machine
+ Also the lecturer showed how to protect yourself against some types of attacks by changing the javascript settings on the browser

## XSS story (h3-y)
On a beautifyl Sunday morning Tero wakes up and turns the coffee machine on. His routine includes reading the news from his new ultra widescreen display while sipping coffee. He casually browses around the internet news sites and for no particular reason he decides to check his emails as well.

As he casually checks the inbox for unread messages he notices an important email from his favourite news site that there has been multiple failed logins and that he should check and confirm if these logins were indeed made by him and not by some malicious attacker. Cold sweat starts to drizzle from Tero's temples as he surely hasn't tried to login to the site in the middle of the night!

In a moment of panic Tero decided that for sure this needs to be checked. Luckily the news site had included a link in the email from where he could review the incidents reported. Tero clicks the link and is directed to the news site login page where he's required to provide his credentials. Tero logs in and to his relief the report there shows that there is no need for further actions as these attempts were indeed already identified as false logins and dealt with accordingly. Tero calms down and is instantly relieved that his favorite news agency indeed was on top of things.

As he leans in for his coffee cup and starts slowly to take his next sip the speakers burst out the first notes from James Brown's 'I feel good' at an insanely loud volume! Tero jumps to the air and spills the cup of semi-hot coffee all over himself and his brand new widescreen display. Sunday is ruined!

Little did he know that the email was indeed from an attacker who used the news site to run malicious code on Tero's browser. Not only did the attacker get Tero's login details he also ruined the normally blissful Sunday coffee moment for Tero.

## SQLZoo (h3-a)

### 0 SELECT basics
Here the basics of the SQL SELECT statement were introduced with by a few simple tasks of replacing parameters to get different results.
```
SELECT population FROM world WHERE name = 'Germany'
SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE name IN ('Sweden', 'Norway', 'Denmark')
SELECT name, area FROM world WHERE area BETWEEN 200000 AND 250000
```

![SELECTbasics](./SELECTbasics.png)

### 2 SELECT from tasks 1-5
Here the tasks included some basic SQL SELECT statements to be made to retrieve certain information and do some simple calculations. On a side note it's useful to use the AS statement to rename the calculated fields correctly.
```
SELECT name, continent, population FROM world
SELECT name FROM world WHERE population >= 200000000
SELECT name, gdp/population AS per_capita_gdp FROM world WHERE population >= 200000000
SELECT name, population/1000000 as population_in_millions FROM world WHERE continent='South America'
SELECT name, population FROM world WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy')
```

## Darn Low Security (h3-b)
Here I browsed into the DVWA and logged in with the default privileges 'admin' and 'password'. After which I went in and changed the Script Security to 'low'.

![DVWAScriptSecurityLow](./DVWAlow.png)

## Execute! (h3-c)
Here the idea was to try out the command execution. As I knew that with the '&' character one can run another command after the first one on Linux I just tried that to see if I could put my own command there after the ping command.
```
&pwd&ls
```

And sure enough I got a response:

![ls](./ls.png)

Then I needed to figure out how to get spaces into the commands which I was not familiar with. After a little bit of searching from the internet I found a way to put the wanted command into a variable and be able to run that with the injection (source: https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/bypass-bash-restrictions). With a little bit of trial and error I finally got out the /etc/passwd contents.
```
&PASS=$'cat\x20/etc/passwd'&&$PASS
```

![passwd](./passwd.png)

Only after I found out these details on how to get the space out of the equation I noticed that the input actually passed spaces too so a simple `&cat /etc/passwd` would've done the trick :satisfied:

## Webgoat (h3-d)

### SQL injections
I did this previously already, here is the link:

https://github.com/arcane-tl/coursework/blob/main/Penetration%20Testing/h0-h1/h0-h1.md#a1-injection

### Authentication Bypasses

So here I started up Burp and went on to remove the security question parameters as instructed but it didn't work out. I got the answer "Not quite..." I also tried to get rid of the security question option too and also tried to add two empty parameters to replace the removed ones. Nothing worked until finally I changed the security question parameternames to "secQuestion2" and "secQuestion3" which yielded a pass.

### JWT Tokens (optional)

I continued to work with the JWT tokens for some reason. Here it's needed to understand how JWT tokens work and how one is made. On the first task it was needed to get admin privileges to trash some votes. I set continued to intercept the traffic with Burp as the proxy and got the JWT token for Tom from there.

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2NjkxNzc2MDAsImFkbWluIjoiZmFsc2UiLCJ1c2VyIjoiVG9tIn0.TQtmWujbYPnfuDAbgt-U57yJzyq4w8VP8CZhGXyNw7MWyAYGc9TpmInHegiId6l3LLAdcdU5EBDCJOza1xHNfA
```

I pasted that into a text file and continued to crack the token with hashcat using the rockyou.txt dictionary.
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 jwt2.txt ../rockyou.txt
```
It was quickly cracked as the secret used was very weak: 'victory'. Now it was only a matter of changing the admin-parameter in the JWT token Base64 encoded payload to true instead of false and create a new token with it.

{"iat":1669177600,"admin":"false","user":"Tom"} = {"iat":1669177600,"admin":"true","user":"Tom"}

After the value was set to true I pasted the new token instead of the old and got a pass on this task.

![passJWT](./passJWT.png)

On the next task WebGoat gave a token to crack to change the username for the token. Did the same drill with hashcat and it quickly cracked the secret: 'shipping'. Then I went on to change the username careful to input it correctly with uppercase and lowercase in place. At first run I forgot to change the expiration date for the token but on the second go I changed that too and got a pass.

### Insecure login
Here the task was to intercept login details from an unencrypted packet and submit them. I solved this using Burp as proxy and getting the needed details from there.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
In this section XSS was explained a bit more in detail with some examples. One might be vulnerable to XSS attacks trough search fields, user input fields and error messages that contain user input data. The tasks in this section were related to XSS and cookie handling. First task was to run some javascript on your browser windows and compare the document.cookie values which were the same on all tabs.

Second task was to identify the field susceptible to XSS attack. I decided to inject a simple alert to the fields and see what I could get.
```
<script>alert('test');</script>
```
Sure enough the credit card number field was susceptible and resulted in an alert popping on my browser.

### Cross-Site Request Forgeries
First off was the basic get CSRF exercise and I was lost with this one. Didn't understand what I needed to do or how to approach the thing. I did understand the basic concept around CSRF but had no idea on how to approach this task. Finally I looked it up from the internet and found a solution where it said to basically write the same form on your own html page and do the "submit" action using the page that you created locally (source: https://github.com/vernjan/webgoat/blob/master/09-2018-csrf.md).

Following this advice I found the form code using the developer console:

![CSRFflag](./CSRFflag.png)

Then I created the simple html csrf.html and opened that on a new tab with the same browser I had opened the webgoat previously and got the task completed.
```
<html>
  <body>
    <form accept-charset="UNKNOWN" id="basic-csrf-get" method="POST" name="form1" target="_blank" successcallback="" action="http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/csrf/basic-get-flag">
      <input name="csrf" type="hidden" value="false">
      <input type="submit" name="submit">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```
Result:

![solved1](./CSRFsolved1.png)

Next task was similar to this so I reused the html that I created and got the necessary information for the payload from the developer tools.
```
<html>
  <body>
    <form method="POST" action="http://localhost:8080/WebGoat/csrf/review">
      <input name="reviewText" value="blahblah" type="hidden">
      <input name="stars" value="1" type="hidden">
      <input name="validateReq" value="2aa14227b9a13d0bede0388a7fba9aa9" type="hidden">
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```
Result:
