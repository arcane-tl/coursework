## Conducting a penetration test with Metasploit (h2-x)

Task here was to read and summarize the chapter 1 "Penetration Test Using Metasploit" starting from "Conducting a penetration test with Metasploit" to the end of the chapter of "Mastering Metasploit" by Nipun Jaswal.

Here we started off by going through the basic terminology and some useful commands in the Metasploit framework from Metasploit and Meterpreter. Next in the article there were some of the benefits of using Metasploit listed:

+ It's an actively developed open source system
+ Metasploit supports large networks
+ Switching payloads is easy
+ Cleaner exit from compromised system

In my opinion having a database based solution with separate workspaces for results and reporting and also having an integrated exploit database in use are pretty big benefits too compared to manual hacking process.

Rest of the article was dedicated to a case study on how to gain access to an IP address using Metasploit. This case study covered:

+ Gathering intelligence
+ Using workspaces and databases in Metasploit
+ NMAP port scanning
+ Threat modeling
+ Vulnerability analysis
+ Exploitation
+ Lateral movement

## Installing Metasploitable 2 (h2-a)

Task here was to install Metasploitable 2 on a virtual machine in a separate virtual network with testing machine. I did this during the lessons already so the steps documented here are memorized:

1. Downloaded Metasploitable 2 from rapid7.com and verified the checksum.
2. Created a new virtual machine in VirtualBox and linked the downloaded disk to the VM
3. Created a new host-to-host virtual network on VirtualBox with DHCP
4. Configured the new virtual network to my Kali Linux testing machine and the Metasploitable2 VM
5. Tested communication between the VM's with ping
