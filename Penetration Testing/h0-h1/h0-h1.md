# Capturing network traffic, WebGoat and Darknet Diaries (h0-h1)
## Installing Kali-linux (h1-d)
At the beginning of this course I installed Kali-linux on VirtualBox by Oracle to do the tasks needed for the course work. Installation was simple using the documentation from [kali.org](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/).

First step was to download the VirtualBox image which was readily available from the [kali.org virtual machines](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines) section.

![Kali virtual image downloads](./kali%20download.png "kali.org virtual images")

After downloading it's useful to check that the SHA256 checksum from kali.org matches with the downloaded files checksum to make sure the file has not been tampered with during transit.

Checksum from kali.org for the file:

![Kali 64bit VirtualBox SHA256sum](./Kali%20SHA256sum.png "Checksum from kali.org")

Checksum calculated using Microsoft Powershell Get-FileHash:

![Downloaded file SHA256sum](./downloaded%20SHA256sum.png "Checksum from local file")

I already had Oracle VirtualBox installed on my Windows 10 desktop so adding the Kali-linux was simple. I did tweak a bit of the virtual machine properties and allocated a bit more memory and CPU for the VM.

## Network packet sniffing (h0-a)
When the Kali-linux was set up I thought about changing the default usernames and passwords of the virtual machine but decided that it's not worth the effort for these exercises at this point. I might change my mind later. Next I wanted to test that the setup works correctly so it was time to fire up Wireshark and capture some packets.

So the plan here is to:
1. Open Wireshark and CLI[^1] in Kali Linux
2. Start Wireshark capture on the network interface & create some network traffic with ping
3. Export the captured packets to a file
4. Analyze what happened

### 1. Open Wireshark and CLI in Kali Linux

![wireshark and CLI](./wireshark%20CLI.png "Wireshark and CLI opened in Kali-Linux")

### 2. Start Wireshark capture on the network interface & create some network traffic with ping

First we need to choose the network interface from Wireshark from which we want to capture the packets. In my case it will be the default network interface eth0. After this selection the capture will be live. On idle there should be little or no network traffic to or from Kali Linux so next we need to run a ping command on the CLI[^1]:

```
ping www.google.com -c 3
```

Then ping-command sends an echo request to the hostname you have specified using ICMP -protocol and if ICMP is enabled for the target we should get a response from it.

![wireshark packets](./wireshark%20packets.png "Captured packets from ping-command in Wireshark")

### 3. Export the captured packets to a file

File-menu > Export Packet Dissections > As Plain Text...

![exporting capturelog](./export%20captured%20packets%20as%20text.png "Export packets as plain text from Wireshark")

### 4. Analyze what happened

The first 4 packets here are DNS[^2] queries as you can see from the protocol and the info fields:

![DNS query](./DNS%20query.png "DNS query packets")

DNS[^2] is responsible for translating human readable network access information into IPv4 or IPv6 interpretations which the computers use communicate or vice versa.

Here we can see that there were two types of queries sent from my localhost to the DNS server configured for my local network. First query is type A query which means IPv4 version of the DNS[^2] query and the second type is AAAA query that will return an IPv6 response from the DNS server. And as we can see from the packet info we did actually get both IPv4 and IPv6 responses for www.google.com.

The next two packets are the echo packets for the ping-command. So in the first packet we're sending an ICMP request to the target asking for a reply and the second packet is the reply from the target host itself. Here on the highlighted echo request we can actually see that it was sent using IPv4.

![ping echo packets](./echo%20packets.png "Ping request and response")

After that we see another two DNS[^2] packets where my computer as the localhost is doing a PTR query (pointer) asking the DNS server for the hostname of the target and here the target is replying with the associated hostnames.

![PTR response](./PTR%20response.png "DNS PTR query response")

There is a lot more to analyze in these packets still and a lot of information that can be derived from these request and response packets such as port numbers, MAC addresses, etc. But that is a discussion for another time.

![Additional information](./additional%20information.png "Additional information from the packets")

## WebGoat (h1-a, h1-b)
[WebGoat](https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/) is an open source web application whose development is lead by the OWASP[^3].

*"WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers just like you to test vulnerabilities commonly found in Java-based applications that use common and popular open source components."*
Source: https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/

WebGoat is new to me so I haven't used or tried anything with this tool. Seems that in the Kali-Linux virtualbox image the necessary pre-requisites were in place for my installation and I proceeded to install and run the application as detailed in https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/.

### HTTP Basics
In this section some basic concepts were discussed on how HTTP transfers data between the browser and the web application and these concepts were demonstrated by a couple of simple forms.

![HTTP Basics](./HTTPbasics1.png)

At the end of the section there was a quiz form where I needed to answer if the HTTP command was POST or GET and then find out the magic number for the second answer.

To find out the answer for the magic number you need to pop out the developer tools or use some of Kali-Linux installed proxy tools to intercept the HTTP request and reply. I decided to first try with the developer tools and opened it with F12 and popped it out on a separate window. After that I wanted to try the proxy approach too and opened Burp Suite from the Kali-toolkit and turned on packet interception with the proxy tool there. With both tools I was able to get the quiz done.

Here is the request on developer tools where under the headers you can see the request method which is POST:

![POST](./request%20method.png "Answer: POST")

And under the Payload-tab you can see the magic_num which was 53:

![magic_num](./magic_num.png "Answer: 53")

And same by using the Burp Suite:

![Burp answer](./burp.png "Answer: POST & 53")

### Developer Tools
I've used developer tools quite a lot during my work and hobbies so this part was pretty simple for me. It's not everytime I run some functions there but it's quite normal to check some information or background using the developer tools regarding websites.

So here I basically opened the developer tools and cleared the logs before I ran the webgoat.customjs.phoneHome() and I got the correct result from the response to that call:

![console](./consoleTab.png)

And regarding the network tab task I did the same, cleared the log and then clicked "Go!" and then looked at the request details from the results:

![network](./networkTab.png)

### HTTP proxy
Here the idea was to use the request method, contents and headers using a HTTP proxy. I decided to use Burp as it comes preinstalled in Kali-Linux. From Burp you choose the Proxy-tab, open Burp browser and then turn intercept on. This will setup Burp to intercept the request and allows you to modify it before forwarding it. After modifying all the necessary values the puzzle is solved.

### CIA Triad
In this section the CIA Triad method was introduced and to pass this section I needed to do a quiz regarding confidentiality, integrity and availability.

![CIA Triad](./CIAtriad.png)

### (A1) Injection

#### SQL Injection (Intro)
First task here was to retrieve the department for an employee named Bob Franco. We had full rights to the table so this was simple with a normal SQL SELECT query:
```
SELECT department FROM Employees WHERE userid=96134
```

![SQLquery](./sql1.png)

For the next part it was asked to change the department for one employee. This is also basic SQL query with admin privileges.
```
UPDATE Employees SET department='Sales' WHERE first_name='Tobi' AND last_name='Barnett'
```

![SQL Update](./SQL2.png)

Next task was to add column 'phone' to the 'Employees' table.

```
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD phone varchar(20)
```

![SQL ALTER](./SQL3.png)

And for the next part access needed to be modified for the 'UnauthorizedUser' to have the rights to alter tables.

```
GRANT ALTER TABLE TO UnauthorizedUser
```

![SQL GRANT](./SQL4.png)

Next part of this section was dedicated to explaining and trying out SQL injections. Here the basic idea modify an input or a property to be able to manipulate the underlying SQL query to the attackers benefit so that the attacker can run the SQL queries needed for the attack.

Basic injection with if an obvious true statement like 1=1:

![SQL INJECTION1](./SQL5.png)

Another basic injection with an obvious true statement like 1=1:

![SQL INJECTION2](./SQL6.png)

Another basic injection with an obvious true statement like 1=1:

![SQL INJECTION3](./SQL7.png)

Next task required a different kind of injection where the dynamic query is terminated with ; and an UPDATE query is added after that.

```
ascac
asvav' UPDATE Employees SET SALARY=1000000 WHERE AUTH_TAN='3SL99A
```

![SQL INJECTION4](./SQL8.png)

And as the last task we clear our tracks by getting rid of the access_log. It's worth noticing that the query is ended with '--' which comments out rest of the original dynamic query.

```
blahblah'; DROP TABLE access_log;--
```

So there it is, SQL Injection (intro) session finished.

![SQL INTRO DONE](./SQLintroDone.png)

So far I've finished from the WebGoat the "General" lessons and from A1 all the "SQL Injection (Intro)" lessons.

## Bandit (h1-c)
Task was to solve the first three levels in [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).

This site was completely new for me so I haven't visited this before. Let's see what we can find out :)

I won't be posting the solutions here as per the rules for the Bandit wargames but I will add a screencap as proof of access.

### Level 0
Task here was to login to the bandit game server using SSH port 2220 with the provided authentication details.

I did this in Kali-Linux that I installed to do the tasks for this course.

![bandit0](./bandit%20login.png)

### Level 1
Objective here was to login to the system with bandit1 privileges by getting the password from bandit0 files.

![bandit1](./bandit1.png)

### Level 2
Objective here was to find the secret for bandit2 user from an obscured filename.

![bandit2](./bandit2.png)

### Level 3
Another obscured filename puzzle.

![bandit3](./bandit3.png)

Pretty simple levels so far, took me 5 minutes to go from level 0 to level 3.

## challenge.fi (h1-e)

I decided to go for the "Encoding Basics 129" challenge which was to determine what this is:

RkxBR3tMb29rc19yZWFsbHlfY3J5cHRpY19idXRfaXNfZWFzaWx5X3JldmVyc2VkfQ==

To me it looked like base64 encoded message as it ends with two '=' characters and does fit into base64 standard of being multiple of 4 characters.

I decided to run it trough Windows PowerShell conversion and see what I get.

```
[Text.Encoding]::Utf8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String('RkxBR3tMb29rc19yZWFsbHlfY3J5cHRpY19idXRfaXNfZWFzaWx5X3JldmVyc2VkfQ=='))
```

![base64 hash](./base64.png)

The result looks like I hit the jackpot with my guess but you never know if someone has derived their own encryption method :)

p.s. I noticed this task after I already shared my link in the app for the tasks but still decided to update this since I still had time.

## Darknet Diaries (h1-x)

### Episode 107: Alethe
In this episode the topic was social engineering aspect of hacking. In my opinion a lot of the work related to hacking is information gathering and social engineering rather than tinkering with expoits or getting the latest applications or hardware to breach something. Of course it would be easier if the hacks could be done without the need to do reconnaissance or get physical access to the network but this rarely is the case.

Alethe is a hacker specialized in social engineering. In this episode we get to know her life story and how she ended up into the business of hacking. Her story goes from childhood in Africa and United States to current day through many twists and turns. On the way she tells about her experiences in Defcon participating the social engineering village capture the flag contests and how she won the contest on the second time she participated.

Topics discussed here:
+ OSINT[^4]
+ Social Engineering
+ Phone Spoofing
+ Defcon (defcon.org)
+ Phishing
